## RailEye: Highway Grade Crossing Trespassing Detection

Our team built a full-stack system, applying state-of-the-art vision-based artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies for the recognition and comprehension of grade-crossing video data. This solution has been successfully deployed across 10+ diverse locations, collecting data over a span of 3+ years. Notably, a detailed one-year data analysis [paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/03611981231163824) focused on a New Jersey site has been published in the TRR journal.

Here are my main contributions:

* Generalized the signal activation detector, enhancing its adaptability and extending its utility across various scenarios. Improved object detection accuracy and reduce object tracking duplicated rate. 

* Effectively heightened object detection accuracy through algorithm refinement.

* Implemented strategic measures to reduce the occurrence of duplicate object tracking, optimizing system accuracy.

* Spearheaded the transformation of a complex monolithic system into a modular and scalable microservices architecture, unlocking enhanced system agility and responsiveness.

* Pioneered the development of an advanced post-processing toolkit, enabling validation of AI predictions and facilitating comprehensive analysis of trespassing data.
